# node-red-node-ui-editable-table
This node is based on the capabilities of the Tabulator library and allows 
the user to define complex - editable tables and constructs.

Credit must go to Kazuhito Yokoi for his inspiration.

This node differs from node-red-node-ui-table due to it being more native to
the Tabulator libraries, it allows very complex editable tables to be built.
